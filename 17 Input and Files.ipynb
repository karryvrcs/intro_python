    "Very often, we want to work with data that has already been collected or generated elsewhere. This might take the form of data from online surveys, or acoustic monitoring sensors, or perhaps the results of intensive fluid-dynamics simulations carried out on huge remote clusters of computers. There are a vast number of possible formats for data, and ways of reading it into Python, so we will focus only on the simplest."
