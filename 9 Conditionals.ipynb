    "In the previous worksheets, we've seen two ways in which we can control how the lines of a program are executed  (which we sometimes call the ***control flow*** of the program): we can use `for` loops to repeat lines of code, and functions to separate lines of code into smaller blocks. There is only one more fundamental concept we need for manipulating the control flow. This is the ability to make decisions based on ***conditions***.\n",
    "\n",
    "In normal speech, when giving instructions we often use conditions. For example: \"*if* the traffic light is red *then* stop\". This has a direct analogue in Python: the simple `if` statement, which has the following form:\n",

    "As always, the indentation is critical. The indented statements are the body of the `if` statement, and will only be executed if the condition holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical computing, the conditions we are interested in are often relationships between numbers. For example, we can test whether `a` is equal to `b` using `a == b` (**notice there are *two* `=` signs**).\n",

    "The function above follows a very common code ***pattern***. A pattern is like a \"template\" for solving a particular type of problem. Here the more general problem is \"non-existence of an object with some property\", which we can test by iterating through all of the possibilities for that object, returning `False` if one of them has the given property, and returning `True` after exhausting all of the possibilities. It's worth thinking about what patterns you are using while you code. Can you see what the analogous pattern would be for checking \"*existence* of an object with some property\"? What about \"*all* objects have some property\", or \"all objects do not have some property\"?"
